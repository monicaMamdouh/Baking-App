You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.
In this project you will:

1-Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
2-Handle error cases in Android.
3-Add a widget to your app experience.
4-Leverage a third-party library in your app.
5-Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
